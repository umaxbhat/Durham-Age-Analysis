# Durham-Age-Analysis

This analysis takes at the growth of the share of Durham County's population in each age bracket from 2017 to 2022. 

The data used in this analysis was pulled from the 1-year American Community Survey. Data from 2020 was not available due to the pandemic. 

I referenced this page to learn how to loop over a list of years: https://mattherman.info/blog/tidycensus-mult-year/.
